  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm just some guy interested in philosophy, thoughts, understanding of the world, programming and healthy lifestyle. This site is going to feature anything that interests me and I feel like sharing with the world. Thats inclusive of Music, Books, Movies, My thoughts on specific topics. </p>
  <p>I am very new to coding though. I created this website to learn about and progress my knowledge of coding in general. I'm doing all this on my majestic Thinkpad T14 Gen2 with Fedora /Windows (for academic purposes). </p>
  <p>I can pretty confidently say that I'am a part of the first generation to have their personalities and lives molded by the internet, which is somewhat cool and scary at the same time. The amount of technological progress that has been achieved during my life has been astonishing; from 64-bit x86 CPU's to 8k televisions, it's just crazy thinking that people were still using Pentium 4's and Windows XP when I was born.</p>
  <p>I'm socially awkward, Well, I like all of my friends as they constantly keep up with my crap.</p>
  <p>Explore different aspects of my professional and personal journey below:</p>
